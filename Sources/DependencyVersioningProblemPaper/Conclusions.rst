Conclusions
===========

In my opinion allowing multiple versions of one dependency is the only possible solution to the
*Dependency Versioning Problem* that has the potential to solve it in its most general form, when no global
orchestration of the involved dependencies is possible. It would remove the need for compatibility schemes
of questionable correctness that additionally put a great maintenance burden on library developers.
